📊 Personal Monthly Budget Dashboard – Built with Microsoft Excel

I created this dynamic budget dashboard to manage and visualize monthly income and expenses more effectively. 💸📅

This solution helps track how money flows each month with:
✔️ Month & year selection with automatic filtering
✔️ Income and expense summary per category
✔️ Category-wise totals with meaningful icons
✔️ Real-time balance updates
✔️ Clear monthly financial overview

🔧 Skills applied:
🔹 Monthly income & expense tracking
🔹 Excel formulas (SUMIFS, data validation)
🔹 Data validation lists (month and years selectors)
🔹 Personal finance planning using spreadsheets
🔹 Organized structure for manual data entry

🛠️ Tool Used: Microsoft Excel
